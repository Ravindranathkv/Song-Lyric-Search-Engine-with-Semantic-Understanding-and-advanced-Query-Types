    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will get first hand experience building a text-based mini search engine. In particular, there are three main learning objectives: (i) the basics of tokenization (e.g. stemming, case-folding, etc.) and its effect on information retrieval; (ii) basics of index building and Boolean retrieval; and (iii) basics of the Vector Space model and ranked retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

    "Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word in a text corpus is proportional to its rank in the frequency table of the corpus, with the most frequent word having a rank of 1. This means that the most frequent word in a corpus is likely to be much more common than the second most frequent word, which is in turn much more common than the third most frequent word, and so on.  \n",
    "From the above plot, we can observe a slope that decreases linearly from left to right. This slope represents the power-law relationship between frequency and rank. The steeper the slope, the stronger the relationship. As the slope is close to -1, this means that the frequency of elements decreases very rapidly as their rank increases."

    "Using the TF-IDF algorithm, lyrics that are more pertinent to the search query are given a better ranking. This algorithm considers the term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) of the words in the lyrics. However, because it does not use the lyrics' contextual information, it might not perform well in situations when the context is crucial for the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using TF-IDF to calculate the cosine similarity of the vectors that represent the query and the lyrics, this technique determines how similar the query and the lyrics are to one another. When looking for lyrics that are semantically related to a query, this approach to song lyric search might be extremely useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25: Similar to TF-IDF, BM25 is a probabilistic model that determines the relevance score between the search term and the lyrics while accounting for TF and IDF as well as other factors. Because it provides a more comprehensive approach to addressing term frequency and inverse document frequency, BM25 may occasionally be more effective than TF-IDF.\n",

    "As discussed advantages and disadvantages above, and looking at the results for given queries, BM25 algorithm worked better. \n",
